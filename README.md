 Presentation-of-paper :
 
 Exploring many interesting facts in Machine Learning and its applications, I have read a lots of paper in this field with full of real life examples. 
 Basically, Ensemble Methods are very popular and working area now-a-days in different fields such as Computational Biology, Biomathematics etc.
 Here, I have presented the paper: [A dynamic, ensemble learning approach to forecast dengue fever epidemic years in Brazil using weather and population susceptibility cycles](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.1006) under the guidance of [Dr. Tanujit Chakraborty](https://www.ctanujit.org/) in online mode.
